# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## 2. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle
The high-level process of completing a project and the procedures necessary to do so are fundamentally described by the project management life cycle. The project management life cycle can be characterised as a structured, organised, and systematic procedure for successfully starting, planning, and carrying out a project in order to achieve the intended goals of the stakeholders funding the project. A distinct aspect of the process of managing a project from inception to completion is addressed by each project phase. Though they are listed in order, many of these phases may overlap or be used at the same time during the course of a project.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:


A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved. As for the Grammar Checker Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructured to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as interface design, API management, text preprocessing, and grammar checking:

### Scope

In this grammar checker project, we need to identify the scope of the project. Grammar Checker makes an effort to ensure that written content is grammatically accurate. Grammar checkers can be used independently from other applications that work with editable text, although they are most frequently integrated as a function of bigger products like word processors.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor quality attitude; poor design, materials, and workmanship; insufficient quality assurance of system)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance of System: The system gives error when receiving other languages as input. <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance of System: The system could not differentiate the tenses (present, past, continuous, etc.) well.  |The system gives inaccurate output during the unit testing phase.|Assign one member to collect data on a daily basis and increase the dataset until a satisfactory result is obtained.|
|Cost <br> (Errors in estimation; insufficient productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|Errors in estimation: Project budget has big difference with the cost estimated in the planning phase.|Allocated budget is insufficient.|To compensate for an insufficient phase budget, reduce and balance the overall project cost.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) |The progress of the project delayed compared to estimated time.|Certain tasks are not completed according the milestone in Gantt Chart.|Ask for additional time for the project completion if possible, or switch the task between team members to have different point of view.|
