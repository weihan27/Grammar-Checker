### Project Management Life cycle
The high-level process of completing a project and the procedures necessary to do so are fundamentally described by the project management life cycle. The project management life cycle can be characterised as a structured, organised, and systematic procedure for successfully starting, planning, and carrying out a project in order to achieve the intended goals of the stakeholders funding the project. A distinct aspect of the process of managing a project from inception to completion is addressed by each project phase. Though they are listed in order, many of these phases may overlap or be used at the same time during the course of a project.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:
