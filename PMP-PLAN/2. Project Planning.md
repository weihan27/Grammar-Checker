# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## 2. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle
The high-level process of completing a project and the procedures necessary to do so are fundamentally described by the project management life cycle. The project management life cycle can be characterised as a structured, organised, and systematic procedure for successfully starting, planning, and carrying out a project in order to achieve the intended goals of the stakeholders funding the project. A distinct aspect of the process of managing a project from inception to completion is addressed by each project phase. Though they are listed in order, many of these phases may overlap or be used at the same time during the course of a project.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:


A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved. As for the Grammar Checker Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructured to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as interface design, API management, text preprocessing, and grammar checking:

### Scope

In this grammar checker project, we need to identify the scope of the project. Grammar Checker makes an effort to ensure that written content is grammatically accurate. Grammar checkers can be used independently from other applications that work with editable text, although they are most frequently integrated as a function of bigger products like word processors.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor quality attitude; poor design, materials, and workmanship; insufficient quality assurance of system)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance of System: The system gives error when receiving other languages as input. <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is biased towards a certain design of the car plate.  |How: The output result always segmented the wrong part of the car plate <br> <br> When: The quality problem of will be determined during the unit testing phase|Assign one member to keep on collecting the data day to day and increased the dataset until a satisfied result is determined.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: The costing of the server will be spike if one of the developer forget to shutdown the EC2 instance when not using it. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: Team members are affected by covid-19 and unable to deliver what they suppoosed to deliver which lead to extra cost need to allocated for the cloud servers. |How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email or discord whenever budget exceed threshold in the AWS cloud computing service.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough server to be used to run the car plate recognition model training  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ask support from the other team member and switch their task or job to other job to avoid him/her to stuck in the problem loop.|
