# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
### Project Summary
Grammar explains the forms and structure of words (called morphology) and how they are arranged in sentences (called syntax). In other words, grammar provides the
rules for common use of both spoken and written language so we can more easily understand each other. Parsing natural language has remained a difficult problem in computer science, mainly due to the lack of clarity in the underlying structure of sentences. 

Words can mean many different things. For instance, "I saw her duck" could refer to either a verb or a noun. Because of this uncertainty, parsers have a hard time figuring out a sentence's meaning or grammatical structure.

In this case, Grammar Checker is software embedded into a word processor to find grammatical errors in the writing. Grammar Checker usually checks for improper word 
usage and sentence structure, incorrect punctuation, and other obscure mistakes.
